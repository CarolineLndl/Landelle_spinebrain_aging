### Overview
This repository support the project on spinal cord structural-functional architecture and its age related changes.   
Most of the code was written in Python 3.10 and some analyses also were done in Matlab 2024b to access SPM.  

🛠️ Toolboxes used include:
- Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT, version 5.6.0; De Leener et al., 2017)  
- Oxford Center for fMRI of the Software Library (FSL, version 5.0)   
- Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12, running on Matlab 2021b)  
- Tapas PhysiO toolbox (release 2022a, V8.1.0; Kasper et al., 2017)  
- Nilearn toolbox (version 0.9.1)

## 4. Run the Analysis Pipeline ⚙️
<details><summary>Here is a brief description of the files used for data analysis.</summary>

- **`CL_brsc_aging_env.sh`**:: project's environment
- **`code/`**: Functions and code to run the analyses. Do not modify the file.- */code/spm/* : this folder contain the matlab scripts used with SPM
    - **`code/SPM`**: this folder contain the matlab scripts used with SPM
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for paths and parameters.
  - **`config/preprocessing/*.json`**: config files used for preprocessing (i.e used by the notebooks in notebook/preprocessing/)
  - `participants.tsv` contains demographical information and important info for preprocessing (*e.g.,* slice number for vertebrae labeling initiation)
- **`template`**: Used for analyses; do not modify.
- **`notebook`**: The notebook folder contain the different notebooks used to run and vizualized the results. Notebook's number correspond to the related figure number
    - **`notebook/preprocessing/`** : notebooks used for preprocessing

## 4.1 Preprocessing notebooks:
*For details on the preprocessing steps, please refer to the notes within each notebook.*
- Run the codes in the following order:
    - `01a_brsc_preprocess_func.ipynb` > functional and T1w preprocessing
    - `01b_brsc_preprocess_dartel.ipynb` > brain DARTEL template creation

> ⚠️  Some steps need to be manually corrected, this will imply that all subsequent steps need to be re-run.

Then you can run in parallel the following notebooks for each type of contrast:
- `02_brsc_denoising.ipynb` > functional denoising
- `03_sc_preprocess_microstructural.ipynb` > microstructural preprocessing
- `04_sc_preprocess_diffusion.ipynb` > diffusion preprocessing

## 4.2 Main figure notebooks:
*For details on the preprocessing steps, please refer to the notes within each notebook.*
The figure number correspond to the notebook number:
- Figure 1: `Fig01_SpiMorpho.ipynb`
- Figure 2, four notebooks to be run in order:
    - `Fig02a_SpiDyn-BrainDyn_alff.ipynb` > Compute alff
    - `Fig02a_SpiDyn.ipynb` > Compute SpiDyn features and age-related changes. 
    - `Fig02b_SpiFC.ipynb` > Compute functional connectivity analyses and its age-related changes
